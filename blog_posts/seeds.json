I think this is<br>the prettiest world--so long as you don't mind<br>a little dying, how could there be a day in your<br>whole life<br>that doesn't have its splash of happiness?<br>There are more fish than there are leaves<br>on a thousand trees, and anyway the kingfisher<br>wasn't born to think about it, or anything else.<br>When the wave snaps shut over his blue head, the<br>water<br>remains water--hunger is the only story<br>he has ever heard in his life that he could<br>believe.<br>I don't say he's right. Neither<br>do I say he's wrong. Religiously he swallows the<br>silver leaf<br>with its broken red river, and with a rough and<br>easy cry<br>I couldn't rouse out of my thoughtful body<br>if my life depended on it, he swings back<br>over the bright sea to do the same thing, to do it<br>(as I long to do something, anything) perfectly.</div>",
